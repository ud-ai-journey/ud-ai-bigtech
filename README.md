# üöÄ 100 Days to Big Tech Journey
Hey there!

Welcome to my intense 100-day preparation journey where I document every step as I go from curious developer to Big Tech ready candidate, mastering Data Structures & Algorithms, System Design, and AWS.

üå± What This Repo Is
This repository serves as:

- A daily log of progress (coding problems, system design concepts, AWS hands-on)
- A showcase of what dedication + structured learning can achieve
- A resource for others preparing for FAANG+ interviews
- My accountability partner in this challenging but rewarding journey

üéØ Day 1: The Beginning
Starting strong with the fundamentals:

```python
# My commitment for the next 100 days
def big_tech_preparation():
    print("Day 1: Starting my journey to Big Tech!")
    print("Goal: Master DSA + System Design + AWS")
    print("Timeline: 100 days of consistent effort")
    return "Let's build something amazing!"
```

üéØ My Goals

- **Master Data Structures & Algorithms** through daily coding practice
- **Design scalable systems** like the ones used by Big Tech companies
- **Build cloud expertise** with hands-on AWS projects
- **Document everything** for future reference and to help others
- **Land interviews** at FAANG+ companies with confidence

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack I'll Master

**Programming & DSA:**
- Python 
- LeetCode / HackerRank
- Algorithm patterns & techniques

**System Design:**
- Scalable architectures
- Database design
- Caching strategies
- Load balancing
- Microservices

**AWS Cloud:**
- EC2, S3, Lambda
- RDS, DynamoDB
- API Gateway
- CloudFormation
- Monitoring & Security

**Tools & Platforms:**
- GitHub for version control
- Docker for containerization
- System design tools (draw.io, etc.)

‚ú® Follow along and see how consistent effort over 100 days transforms preparation into opportunity. Every algorithm solved, every system designed, every AWS service mastered brings me one step closer to Big Tech!
